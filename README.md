`Computer Science & AI`
<br>

I'm a computer science student, currently specializing in Artificial Intelligence, and I’m building my knowledge of the digital world one step at a time. I love understanding the core of things, not just the surface; so I often try to build apps from scratch whenever possible.
I'm always looking to expand my skills, and recently I've developed a deep interest in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
I might also start posting tech-related videos on my YouTube channel soon:
